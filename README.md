This program is intended to manage a bunch of anime's which can be donwloaded from http://horriblesubs.info/.<br />
At the time it detects all anime automatically in the given paths (Settings -> Path Settings).<br />
It detects all files in the style of **_(= [HorribleSubs] AnimeName - 01 [720p].mkv )_** and adds them to a list.<br />
The anime's in the list can be filtered, deleted (All episodes from this anime), be played with a double klick or via a button,
a scope can be set (on MUSTHAVE every new episode which is not local visible will be added automatically to the list!)<br />
The given feed can be downloaded and given the settings you can add them automatically to a list where all anime can be downloaded.<br />
With the Start-AutoDownload function it will check the folders and RSS Feed every 5 seconds. If there are anime's detected
which are not in the local folder yet and have a SCOPE of "MUSTHAVE" they will be downloaded automatically.<br />
The Download works only if the magnet link is associated with the downloader and has permission to start the download right away.
